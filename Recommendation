My License Recommendation:  Apache License 2.0

Here are the following reasons why one should use Apache 2.0 

Permissive and welcoming to contributors: Users are free to use, modify, distribute, and
sublicense the software under the Apache License 2.0, which is a liberal license. Additionally, 
it expressly accepts developer contributions, making it a contributor-friendly license.

Patent Grant: The Apache License 2.0, in contrast to certain other licenses, contains a 
patent grant that shields users from potential software-related patent claims. This clause 
contributes to the improvement of user and developer security.

Redistribution and Commercial Use: The Apache License 2.0 permits the redistribution of the software, 
including for commercial uses. This is similar to the MIT License. It allows developers to include the 
code with private software because it does not mandate that derivative works be open-source.

Compatibility: The GNU General Public License (GPL) version 3 and the Apache License 2.0 are both compatible open-source licenses.
Developers can include Apache-licensed code into projects with various license requirements because to this interoperability.

Support from the Community: Projects released under the Apache License 2.0 have the support of a sizable community as 
a result of their widespread adoption and use. Increased collaboration and a larger group of potential contributors may 
result from this.
